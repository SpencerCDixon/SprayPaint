# Spray Paint Readme

Spray paint is a super lightweight front end framework designed to give some aesthetics to websites while in development.  I wanted to create something semantic, easy to use, responsive, and all around enjoyable to add on top of so that more people can do backend without looking at an ugly screen all day.  


### To Do:
- Nav Bar  
- Media Queries for grid system  
- Form styling  
- Unordered list styling  
- Ordered list styling

- System for adding images
