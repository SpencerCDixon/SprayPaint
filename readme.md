# Spray Paint Readme

Spray paint is a super lightweight front end framework designed to give some aesthetics to websites while in development.  I wanted to create something semantic, easy to use, responsive, and all around enjoyable to add on top of so that more people can do backend without looking at an ugly screen all day.  
Please feel free to submit pull requests and add on anything that can help make this project grow.

### Help Contribute!

Here are some steps to help contribute:
```
git clone git@github.com:SpencerCDixon/SprayPaint.git spray-paint
cd spray-paint
sass --watch css/sass:css

```

After you have sass going I would open up the index.html in your favorite browser and start getting to work.  Try and make all editions split up into partials which you can do by addding an _ (underscore) to the file name.  Then in the styles.scss you import the partial.  Be aware that you need to import the styles in the correct order so that the variables you want to use are included.


### To Do:

- Nav Bar  
- Media Queries for grid system  
- Form styling  
- Unordered list styling  
- Ordered list styling  
- Final decision on color scheme

- System for adding images  

### Screencast Ideas

- Customizing forms
- Changing overrides to customize the framework
- Building sections/panels
- Creating a navbar


### Urgent

- Fix forms width.  Overflow hidden maybe?
- Add a search button that goes on the side of a text field for searching
- Make buttons have a click to change color instead of showing all of them at
  once.
